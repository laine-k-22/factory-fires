I've been hearing a lot about unusual fires in food factories, 
so I thought it would be interesting to try to make a timeline of these events.

I created a database by using a web scraper to search for "food factory fires", 
"poultry plant fires", "grain factory fires", "meat factory fires", etc. etc. on Google. 
What I got was lots of news reports, some articles about the topic in general, some unrelated posts. 
These results were later filtered out to remove links that didn't come from my predefined list of news portals, 
leaving only the news reports. Afterwards, the duplicates were removed and the publishing dates were extracted.

And here's the results of how many of these articles have been published each month! 

Even looking at it with a grain of salt thereâ€™s an interesting trend happening.
Project done in July, 2022.
